The m-files in the current folder are used to decompose camera images of the azimuthal cross-section of a plasma column into azimuthal eigenmodes.

The main procedure to start with is CalcFFTDec.m (before it was mkfftdec.m).

It uses the camera average procedure fct_a_moviestatistic.m


(Step 1) CalcFFTDec: adapt parameters and run it
(Step 2) look into phasedata.mat to study phase coupling
